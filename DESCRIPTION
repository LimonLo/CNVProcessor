Description: For CNV data, if the chromosomes in the CNV data are not sequential, 
    this package can be used to fill the uncovered region \(default CN=2\), 
    and the CNV region of multiple samples can be segmented so that two \(or more samples\) can compare the CN of the same region.
    In addition, there are several drawing functions in the package that can be used to simply plot the CNV of a single sample or multiple samples, 
    as well as the results of the sample comparison.
